# MobileTogether-inventory-manager
Example app to demonstrate to demonstrate the design and simulation of a mobile app for enterprise operations management created using MobileTogether.

In our scenario, the inventory manager purchases pre-assembled build kits containing all the unique components for gadgets, gizmos, sprockets, thingamajigs, and widgets to supply customer orders. Complicating the task, some items are individual units, but are also sub-assemblies in larger products. For instance, a thingamajig is composed of 1 buildkitTJ plus 2 sprockets, 1 widget, and 3 connectors.

When the factory is running, the inventory manager’s job is to monitor incoming orders and existing inventory. The manager orders new components as necessary with the goal of maintaining at least 50 percent but no more than 200 percent of average daily demand as parts are consumed on the assembly line.

This app also uses the widgetorders database supplied with the MobileTogether Designer examples.
